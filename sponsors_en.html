        <!-- Page Information -->
        <p style="text-align:left">
        <a href="https://youtube.com/peladonerd">My channel</a> isn’t the largest on the YouTube platform by any means, but I truly value the relationship I’ve built with my community over the past few years and hundreds of videos.<br><br>

        “Sponsored” content is rare on my channel. If I choose to work with a company, it will always be because I actually use the product or service myself and genuinely trust the company to provide excellent customer service and support. More importantly, I will always make it abundantly clear that such content is sponsored.<br><br>

        Most of the equipment and products I use and review have been purchased by me, but sometimes I will rent or borrow equipment for a video. Offering free products in no way guarantees a positive review (or even a review/video at all). Just like with sponsorships, I’m extremely selective about accepting anything for free.<br><br>

        All that being said, there are a few additional points I’d like to make just for the sake of clarity. I’ve made all of this info publicly available to viewers and companies alike so that we’re all on the same page:<br><br>

        • I don't make full dedicated videos to products or services, only integrations (30-60 seconds segments where I talk about your product or service)<br>
        • My content is my own. I create and produce each video based on what I’m excited about and what I think will be relevant/helpful to my audience at the time. The topic of the video is not negotiable, I also don't give the topic of the video before hand.<br>
        • My reviews are always objective and my opinions are always my own. <br>
        • I do not submit previews of full videos to anyone for approval or revisions. Although I do share previews of the sponsored segment if desired.<br>
        • I appreciate when companies offer information about their products/services, but I will only include what I think is relevant and necessary.<br>
        • I will work to seek answers for anything about a product/service that I don’t fully understand.<br>
        • I do not guarantee any number of views or any amount of audience engagement on any videos. While I want every video to do well, there are too many variables beyond my control for me to make any claims regarding potential viewership.<br>

        Thank you for taking the time to read and understand my Ethics Statement. This probably doesn’t cover every possible scenario under the sun, but it should give you a pretty solid idea of how highly I value the integrity behind what I do and the relationship I’ve built with my community.<br><br>

        I just want to keep having fun making videos, and that disappears without these guidelines.<br><br>

        As always, if you have any questions, feel free to reach out to me via <a href="mailto:pablo@peladonerd.com">email</a><br><br>

        - Pablo
